# Best Algorithm Finder

The goal of this project is to examine several ML algorithms for classification and clustering
that could adjust to any Dataset and attempt to find which one is more accurate.

## Installation

Use the Pycharm IDE to run the project.
Or you can also run this project on Visual Studio Code.

```bash
Python app.py
```

## Libraries
Python language including following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.preprocessing, flask, classifier & clusterer.

## Dataset
Dataset is available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
Classification& Clustering Algorithms will be used.

## About
In this Best Algorithm Finder, we will use different algorithms for classification and
clustering to find the best algorithm among all for any dataset to find more accurate result. So,
using this Project, we can overcome the problems that we can face during implementation of
algorithms on any dataset and hence can reduce the chances of inaccurate results or less
accurate results.
